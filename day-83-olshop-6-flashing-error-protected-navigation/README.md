## Day 83: Polishing User Experience and Security

Welcome to Day 83 of my coding journey! Today, I focused on two key areas: elevating user experience with informative error handling and enhancing security through admin authorization and protected navigation. Here's a breakdown of the highlights:

**Day 83 Highlights:**

* **Flashing Errors & Staying Informed:** Flashed error messages onto sessions, ensuring they persist even after page reloads for a smoother user experience.

* **Saving Time & Effort:** Implemented user input saving, allowing users to pick up where they left off even after encountering errors.

* **Admin Access Control:** Established admin authorization, restricting sensitive areas of the application to authorized users only.

* **Navigating Securely:** Built protected navigation to prevent unauthorized access and safeguard sensitive data within the online shop.

* **Styling the Journey:** Laid the foundation for a user-friendly navigation experience by setting up base navigation styles.
