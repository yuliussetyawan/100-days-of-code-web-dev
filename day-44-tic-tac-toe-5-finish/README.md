# 100 Days Of Code - 2023 Web Development Bootcamp

## Day 44: Tic Tac Toe Project Continued

Welcome to Day 44 of my 100 Days Of Code journey in the "2023 Web Development Bootcamp." Today, I continued working on the Tic Tac Toe project, making significant progress. Here's a summary of the day's achievements:

**Day 44 Highlights:**

- **Checking For A Winner Or Draw (Game Logic):** Implemented crucial game logic to check for a winner or a draw, adding a competitive aspect to the Tic Tac Toe experience.

- **Ending The Game & Adding Restart Logic:** Concluded the game smoothly by incorporating logic to end the game and providing players with an option to restart for more rounds.

The project is evolving, and with each line of code, I'm enhancing the gaming experience. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue this exciting journey of web development! ðŸš€ðŸ’»ðŸŽ®
