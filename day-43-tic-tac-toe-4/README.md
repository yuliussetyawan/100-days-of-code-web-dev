## Day 43: Tic Tac Toe Project - Game Mechanics Refinement

Welcome to Day 43 of my 100 Days Of Code journey in the "100 Days Of Code - 2023 Web Development Bootcamp." Today marked a pivotal point in the Tic Tac Toe project as I focused on refining the game mechanics. Here's a summary of the day's achievements:

**Day 43 Highlights:**

- **Adding Logic For Starting A Game**: I implemented essential logic to initiate and start a new game, ensuring a smooth user experience from the beginning.

- **Managing Game Rounds (Turns) & Field Selection**: The project advanced with the incorporation of game rounds management and enabling players to select their desired fields during their turns.

- **Tracking Selected Fields On The Game Board**: A key aspect of game development is effective tracking. I successfully implemented the mechanism to track selected fields on the game board, a crucial step toward game completion.

The Tic Tac Toe project is evolving, and the refined game mechanics bring us closer to a fully functional and enjoyable gaming experience. 🚀🕹️ Exciting times ahead!
