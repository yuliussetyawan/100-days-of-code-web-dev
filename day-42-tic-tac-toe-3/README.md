# 100 Days Of Code - Web Development Bootcamp

## Day 42: Continuing the Tic Tac Toe Project

Today's Progress: Today, I continued working on the Tic Tac Toe project. I focused on several key aspects to make the game more interactive and user-friendly.

**Day 42 Highlights:**

- **Handling Form Submission With JavaScript**: I learned how to handle form submissions using JavaScript, a crucial step to enable players to make their moves within the game.

- **Validating User Input With JavaScript**: I implemented user input validation to ensure that only valid moves are accepted, improving the game's integrity.

- **Storing & Managing Submitted Data**: I explored methods for storing and managing the submitted data, which is essential for tracking the game's progress.

These new features are bringing our Tic Tac Toe project to life, making it more functional and enjoyable to play. I'm excited about the progress I've made! ðŸŽ®ðŸ’»
