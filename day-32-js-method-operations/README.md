## Day 32: JavaScript Methods and Operations

Welcome to Day 32 of my 100 Days Of Code journey in the "100 Days Of Code - 2023 Web Development Bootcamp." Today, I delved deeper into JavaScript methods, operations, and string manipulations. Here's a summary of the day's highlights:

**Day 32 Highlights:**

- **Time To Practice: The Problem**: I started the day with a coding challenge to apply my JavaScript knowledge and problem-solving skills.

- **Time To Practice: The Solution**: After tackling the coding challenge, I reviewed and discussed the solution.

- **Introducing Methods**: I explored the concept of methods in JavaScript, which are functions associated with objects and data types. Methods allow us to perform specific actions and manipulations.

- **Making Our Developer Life Easier (Mastered console.log())**: I honed my debugging skills and learned how to use `console.log()` effectively. It's a crucial tool for inspecting and debugging JavaScript code.

- **Math Operations & Working With Different Kinds Of Values**: I delved into mathematical operations in JavaScript, understanding how they work with various data types.

- **The Modulus Operator**: The modulus operator (`%`) was introduced, which is useful for finding remainders in mathematical operations.

- **Math Operations & Math Rules**: I explored more math operations and the rules that govern them, helping me perform accurate calculations.

- **Performing String (Text) Operations**: I ventured into string operations, which involve manipulating and working with text data.

- **JavaScript Operators, Shorthand Operators & Value Types**: I learned about JavaScript operators, shorthand operators, and the different value types used in JavaScript.

- **String Operations & String Methods**: I delved deeper into string operations and string methods that allow us to manipulate text in various ways.
