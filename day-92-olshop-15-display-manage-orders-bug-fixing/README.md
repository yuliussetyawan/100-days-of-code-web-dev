## Day 92: Order Visibility and Refinements

Welcome to Day 92 of my coding journey! Today, I focused on making orders visible for both customers and administrators, polishing the shopping experience, and reflecting on the module's progress. Here's a breakdown of the highlights:

**Day 92 Highlights:**

* **Order Transparency:** Built the ability to display orders for both customers and administrators, providing clear visibility into purchase history and order details.
   - Customers can now easily review their past orders, track their status, and access order information.
   - Administrators gain insights into customer behavior and order trends, enabling efficient order management and fulfillment.

* **Administrative Control:** Empowered administrators with tools to manage orders effectively, ensuring timely processing, seamless fulfillment, and potential order updates or adjustments as needed.

* **Cart Accuracy:** Implemented mechanisms to keep cart items updated and synchronized, preventing unexpected discrepancies and ensuring a consistent shopping experience for customers.

* **Bug Busting and Polishing:** Devoted time to identifying and addressing bugs that arose during development, refining the overall functionality and user experience.
