## Day 61: Blog Page Project Continued

Welcome to Day 61 of my 100 Days Of Code journey in the "2023 Web Development Bootcamp." Today, I continued working on the blog page project, delving into database interactions and dynamic data rendering. Here's a summary of the day's accomplishments:

**Day 61 Highlights:**

- **Connecting To The Database & Querying Data:** Explored the process of establishing a connection to the database and querying data to fetch relevant information.

- **Inserting Data With Placeholders:** Implemented dynamic data injection by using placeholders, allowing for secure and flexible insertion of data into the database.

- **Fetching & Displaying a List Of Blog Posts:** Successfully fetched data from the database and displayed a list of blog posts on the webpage, showcasing the power of backend integration.
