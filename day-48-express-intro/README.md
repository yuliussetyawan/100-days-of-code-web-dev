# 100 Days Of Code - Web Development

## Day 48: Exploring Express.js

Welcome to Day 48 of my 100 Days Of Code journey in web development! Today, I delved into the world of Express.js, a powerful framework for building web applications with Node.js. Here's a summary of my progress:

- **Installing Express with "npm"**: Started by installing Express using Node Package Manager ("npm").

- **Creating a Server with Express**: Established a server using Express and gained hands-on experience in handling HTTP requests and responses.

- **Parsing User Data With Express**: Explored the capability of Express to parse user data from requests, a crucial aspect of web applications.

- **Storing Data in (Server-side) Files**: Learned how to store data on the server side by saving information into files, an essential skill for managing application data.

This marked another exciting step in my journey, unlocking the potential of Express.js for building robust and scalable web applications. Stay tuned for more adventures in web development! 🌐💻✨
