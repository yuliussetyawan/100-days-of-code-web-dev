## Day 33: Understanding the DOM (Document Object Model)

Welcome to Day 33 of my 100 Days Of Code journey in the "100 Days Of Code - 2023 Web Development Bootcamp." Today was all about diving into the Document Object Model (DOM), a fundamental concept in web development. Here's what I learned:

**Day 33 Highlights:**

- **The Global "window" & "document" Objects**: I delved into the global "window" and "document" objects, essential components of the web browser's environment.

- **What Is "The DOM"?**: I gained a clear understanding of "The DOM" and its role as a representation of the web page structure that JavaScript can manipulate.

- **Drilling Into The DOM To Select & Change HTML Elements**: I practiced selecting and changing HTML elements within the DOM, bringing interactivity to web pages.

- **Loading Our Script Correctly**: I ensured my JavaScript scripts load correctly, following best practices for web development.

- **The DOM Tree & DOM Traversal**: I studied the DOM tree structure and mastered DOM traversal techniques, which are vital for web development.
