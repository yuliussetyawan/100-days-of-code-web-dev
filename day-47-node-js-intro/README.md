# 100 Days Of Code - Day 47

## Introduction to NodeJS and Server-side Development

Welcome to Day 47 of my 100 Days Of Code challenge! Today, I embarked on an exciting journey into backend development using NodeJS. Here's a glimpse of what I explored:

- **Module Introduction**: The day started with an introduction to the module, setting the stage for diving into NodeJS.

- **Installing NodeJS**: I kicked things off by installing NodeJS, the runtime that allows JavaScript to run on the server side.

- **Executing NodeJS Code**: Explored the basics of executing code with NodeJS, laying the groundwork for server-side development.

- **Creating a Custom NodeJS Server**: Delved into creating a custom server using NodeJS, a crucial step in building robust backend applications.

- **Handling Requests & Creating Custom Responses**: Explored the intricacies of handling incoming requests and crafting custom responses, key aspects of server-side development.

- **Doing More Server-side Work**: Dived deeper into server-side work, gaining hands-on experience in building dynamic applications.

- **Summary**: Wrapped up the day with a summary of the key concepts covered, reinforcing the knowledge gained.

Excited to continue this journey into backend development with NodeJS! Stay tuned for more updates as I explore the realms of server-side coding. 🌐💡💻
