## Day 50: Exploring ExpressJS and EJS Templates

Welcome to Day 50 of my 100 Days Of Code journey in the "100 Days Of Code - 2023 Web Development Bootcamp." Today, I delved deeper into ExpressJS and explored the powerful EJS template engine. Here's a summary of the day's highlights:

**Day 50 Highlights:**

- **Serving Static Files (CSS & JavaScript)**: I learned how to serve static files like stylesheets and scripts using ExpressJS, enhancing the structure of my web applications.

- **Parsing Form Data & Redirecting Requests**: Handling form data and managing redirects became a crucial part of building dynamic web applications.

- **Adding the EJS Template Engine**: I introduced the EJS (Embedded JavaScript) template engine to my Express app, unlocking the ability to create dynamic and reusable views.

- **Rendering Dynamic Content With Templates**: Leveraging EJS, I explored rendering dynamic content, making my web pages more interactive and user-specific.

- **Outputting Repeated Content With EJS & Loops**: I discovered how to use loops in EJS to efficiently output repeated content, improving the overall efficiency of my templates.

- **Rendering Conditional Content**: Implementing conditional statements in EJS allowed me to display content based on specific conditions, providing a more personalized user experience.

This marks the halfway point in my 100-day coding journey. I'm excited about the progress made so far and the skills acquired in web development.
