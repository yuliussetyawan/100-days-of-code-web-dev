# 100 Days Of Code - 2023 Web Development Bootcamp

## Day 96: REST API Adventures

Welcome to Day 96 of my coding journey! Today, I ventured into the realm of REST APIs, building foundational blocks for data exchange and communication. Here's a breakdown of the highlights:

**Day 96 Highlights:**

* **REST API Introduction:**
    - Gained a solid understanding of RESTful architecture, its principles, and its role in modern web development.

* **Building a Basic REST API:**
    - Constructed my first REST API, establishing endpoints for data retrieval and manipulation.
    - Explored HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with the API effectively.

* **Enhancing Realism and Complexity:**
    - Refined the API to make it more realistic and applicable to real-world scenarios, ensuring practical application and usability.
    - Began exploring the development of more complex REST API structures to handle diverse data relationships and interactions.
