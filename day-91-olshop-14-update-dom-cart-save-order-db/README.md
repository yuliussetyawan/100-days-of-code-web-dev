## Day 91: Dynamic Updates and Order Systems

Welcome to Day 91 of my coding journey! Today, I focused on creating a more responsive cart experience and laying the foundation for order processing. Here's a breakdown of the highlights:

**Day 91 Highlights:**

* **Dynamic Cart Refreshes:** Enhanced the user experience by updating the cart page dynamically after quantity changes, ensuring accurate price calculations and providing immediate visual feedback, resulting in a more fluid and intuitive interaction.

* **Navigating JavaScript's Arithmetic:** Successfully addressed JavaScript's floating point arithmetic quirks to ensure precise and consistent calculations within the cart, maintaining data integrity and preventing potential errors.

* **Building the Order Foundation:** Created an order controller and a basic order model to manage the process of fulfilling customer purchases, establishing a structured approach for handling order data and persisting it in the database.

* **Order Persistence:** Implemented the ability to save orders in the database, ensuring a record of customer transactions for future reference, order tracking, and analysis, laying the groundwork for a robust order management system.
