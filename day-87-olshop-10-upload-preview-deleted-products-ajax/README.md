## Day 87: Dynamic Updates and Streamlined Management

Welcome to Day 87 of my coding journey! Today was all about empowering admins with better control and streamlining the user experience with dynamic updates. Here's a breakdown of the highlights:

**Day 87 Highlights:**

* **Visual Confidence with File Upload Previews:** Added previews for uploaded files, enabling admins to visually confirm the content before adding it to the shop, ensuring accuracy and visual appeal.

* **Efficient Product Management with Deletion:** Implemented the ability to delete products, allowing admins to quickly remove items that are no longer available or relevant, keeping the catalog clean and up-to-date.

* **Seamless Interactions with Ajax and Frontend JavaScript:** Leveraged Ajax and JavaScript to make dynamic DOM updates without full page reloads, creating a smoother and more responsive user experience.

* **Building a Dynamic and User-Friendly Interface:** Focused on enhancing the admin experience with intuitive features and streamlining product management workflows, promoting efficiency and effectiveness.
