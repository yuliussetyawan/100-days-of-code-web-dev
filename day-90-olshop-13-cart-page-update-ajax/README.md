## Day 90: Enhancing the Shopping Cart Experience

Welcome to Day 90 of my coding journey! Today, I focused on providing a clear and interactive cart experience for customers, enabling them to review and manage their selections with ease. Here's a breakdown of the highlights:

**Day 90 Highlights:**

* **Cart Page Creation:** Built a dedicated cart page where users can visualize their chosen items, review prices, and manage quantities, providing a transparent and organized overview of their shopping choices.

* **Visually Appealing Cart:** Applied initial styling to the cart page to enhance its visual appeal and ensure a seamless transition from product browsing, creating a cohesive and engaging user experience.

* **Dynamic Quantity Adjustments:** Enabled users to update item quantities within their carts without full page reloads, utilizing Ajax PATCH requests to provide a smoother and more responsive interaction.

**Stay tuned as I continue to refine the cart functionality, incorporating features like item removal, visual feedback, and potential cart persistence mechanisms to further streamline the shopping journey! Ô∏è**
