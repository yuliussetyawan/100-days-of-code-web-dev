## Day 89: Building a Dynamic Shopping Cart

Welcome to Day 89 of my coding journey! Today was all about laying the foundation for a seamless shopping experience by empowering customers to easily add items to their carts. Here's a breakdown of the highlights:

**Day 89 Highlights:**

* **Structuring the Shopping Cart:** Created a dedicated cart model to effectively manage and store information about items selected by customers, ensuring data organization and smooth checkout processes.

* **Implementing Cart Logic:** Began developing the core logic behind the shopping cart, handling product additions, quantity updates, and potential removals, ensuring a user-friendly and intuitive experience.

* **Dynamic Additions with Ajax:** Enabled users to add items to their carts without full page reloads, leveraging Ajax requests to create a more responsive and seamless interaction, fostering a sense of instant gratification.
