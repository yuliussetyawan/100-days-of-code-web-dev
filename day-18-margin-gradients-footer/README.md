## Day 18: Navigating Margin Collapsing, Gradients, and the 'Places' Page

Welcome to Day 18 of my 100 Days Of Code journey in the "100 Days Of Code - 2023 Web Development Bootcamp." It was another day of deep learning and project development. Here's a glimpse of what I explored today:

**Day 18 Highlights:**

- **Understanding Parent-Child Margin Collapsing**: Today's journey started with diving into the intricate world of margin collapsing between parent and child elements, learning how it affects our layout.

- **Working with CSS Functions - Linear Gradients**: CSS Functions opened up new design possibilities. I explored linear gradients, using them to enhance the visual appeal of our project.

- **Creating a Footer Section**: The foundation of a good project! I crafted a stylish footer section, ensuring it complements the overall design.

- **Styling the Footer**: The devil is in the details! I applied styles to the footer, making it look sleek and professional.

- **Places Page - Overview & Preparations**: I ventured into the 'Places' page, gearing up for the journey by understanding its structure and requirements.

- **Creating the Card Content**: Our 'Places' page started taking shape as I coded and styled card content.

- **Using "position: static"**: Understanding the position property is key to achieving the right layout. I delved into 'position: static' to ensure elements display as expected.

With each passing day, my coding skills evolve, and our project becomes more refined. 🚀🎨

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue my journey through this web development bootcamp and make our project shine! 💻🌐
