## Day 36: Realistic Demos & JavaScript's Styling & Class Management

Welcome to Day 36 of my 100 Days Of Code journey in the "100 Days Of Code - 2023 Web Development Bootcamp." Today was all about diving deeper into JavaScript and exploring its capabilities in terms of styling and class management. Here are the highlights of what I covered:

**Day 36 Highlights:**

- **A More Realistic Demo & Example**: I started the day with a more complex and realistic demonstration of JavaScript's abilities, giving me a deeper understanding of its real-world applications.

- **Introducing "Constant Variables" ("Constants")**: I learned about constants in JavaScript, which are variables that cannot be reassigned once they are defined.

- **Changing Element Styles With JavaScript**: JavaScript enables me to dynamically change element styles on a web page, offering more interactive and engaging user experiences.

- **Managing CSS Classes With JavaScript**: I explored how JavaScript can be used to dynamically add, remove, or toggle CSS classes on HTML elements, providing more control over styling and behavior.

Today's learning opened up new possibilities for enhancing web applications and creating interactive user interfaces. JavaScript continues to be a powerful tool in web development, and I'm excited to apply these concepts in my projects.
