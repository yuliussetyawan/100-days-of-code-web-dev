# 100 Days Of Code - Day 53

## NodeJS, Express Router, and Query Parameters

Welcome to Day 53 of my #100DaysOfCode challenge! Today's coding journey was filled with exploration and learning in the realm of NodeJS and Express.

**Day 53 Highlights:**

- **Importing & Exporting Code**: Explored the power of modularity in NodeJS by understanding how to import and export code, ensuring a more organized and scalable project structure.

- **Express Router for Route Configuration**: Leveraged the Express Router to enhance the structure of route configurations, making the codebase more modular and maintainable.

- **Query Parameters Introduction**: Delved into the world of query parameters and their role in web development. Explored the distinctions between query parameters and route parameters, gaining a deeper understanding of data transmission.

- **Comparison: Query Parameters vs Route Parameters**: Explored the differences and use cases between query parameters and route parameters, recognizing when to employ each for effective data handling.
